To run the script on Kali Linux, you need to follow these general steps:

Open a Terminal:

Open a terminal on Kali Linux. You can usually find the terminal icon in the taskbar, or you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T.
Navigate to the Script's Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you have saved the script. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/script/directory
Make the Script Executable (if needed):

If the script is not executable, you may need to change its permissions using the chmod command. For example:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x script_name.py
Run the Script:

Execute the script using the python3 command. For example:
bash
Copy code
python3 script_name.py
If your system uses Python 3 by default, you might only need python instead of python3.
Follow the On-Screen Instructions:

The script will prompt you with an interactive menu. Follow the on-screen instructions to add logins, view results, and perform other actions.
Remember to replace script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script. If you encounter any issues, check the script for potential errors or messages in the terminal for clues.

Ensure that your Kali Linux system has Python installed. Most versions of Kali Linux come with Python pre-installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
Replace python3 with python if your system uses Python 2 by default.

Please note that running scripts or programs on systems that you don't own or have permission to use for such purposes may violate ethical and legal standards. Always ensure that you have the right to perform the actions specified in your script.
